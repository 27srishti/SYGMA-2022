            SYGMA 2022- MELIORA
          </h2>
          SYGMA MELIORA is a National level IT fest orgranised by the BCA
          department students of Shri Dharmasthala Manjnatheshwara College of
          Business Management, Mangaluru. We focus on applying knowledge into
          technicality which will ultimately enhance ones performance. The theme
          chosen for the SYGMA 2022 is : SYGMA MELIORA - `For the pursuit of the
          better` . As the Universe of Technology is expanding faster than ever,
          we being the explorers have to augment our knowledge to fill the
          voids. In an era of the emergence of many desruptive technologies and
          modernization, predominant changes happen every single day! Newer and
          futuristic mechanisms significantly overshadow the previously loved
          ones, so much so that we forget their existence. As the developers of
          this fast moving technological world, we not only have to be aware of
          it, but, ever so more importantly adapt to it. That’s why the
          transition towards the trend is not an option, but a necessity. So we
          invite you to take up the challenge to be the frontrunner of the ever
          so evolving Virtual World and to realise the importance of
          ‘Upskilling’ to be the ‘Better version of yourself’ in the process.
